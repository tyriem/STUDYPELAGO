# If your application, applet, servlet, library, etc., contains enumeration
# classes, you'll have to preserve some special methods. Enumerations were
# introduced in Java 5. The java compiler translates enumerations into classes
# with a special structure. Notably, the classes contain implementations of some
# static methods that the run-time environment accesses by introspection (Isn't
# that just grand? Introspection is the self-modifying code of a new
# generation). You have to specify these explicitly, to make sure they aren't
# removed or obfuscated:

-keepclassmembers enum * {
    public static **[] values();
    public static ** valueOf(java.lang.String);
}

# More complex applications, applets, servlets, libraries, etc., may contain
# classes that are serialized. Depending on the way in which they are used, they
# may require special attention

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    private static final java.io.ObjectStreamField[] serialPersistentFields;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}

# --- RECOMMENDED ANDROID CONFIG ------------------------------------------

-keep public class * extends android.app.Activity
-keep public class * extends android.app.Application
-keep public class * extends android.app.Service
-keep public class * extends android.content.BroadcastReceiver
-keep public class * extends android.content.ContentProvider

-keep public class * extends android.view.View {
    public <init>(android.content.Context);
    public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet);
    public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet, int);
    public void set*(...);
}

-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
    public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet);
}

-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
    public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet, int);
}

-keepclassmembers class * implements android.os.Parcelable {
    static android.os.Parcelable$Creator CREATOR;
}


# ---- REQUIRED card.io CONFIG ----------------------------------------
# card.io is a native lib, so anything crossing JNI must not be changed

# Don't obfuscate DetectionInfo or public fields, since
# it is used by native methods
-keep class io.card.payment.DetectionInfo
-keepclassmembers class io.card.payment.DetectionInfo {
    public *;
}

-keep class io.card.payment.CreditCard
-keep class io.card.payment.CreditCard$1
-keepclassmembers class io.card.payment.CreditCard {
	*;
}

-keepclassmembers class io.card.payment.CardScanner {
	*** onEdgeUpdate(...);
}

# Don't mess with classes with native methods

-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
    native <methods>;
}

-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
    native <methods>;
}

-keep public class io.card.payment.* {
    public protected *;
